refactor(persistence)!: Formalize QueryDSL and QueryFilter parameters

BREAKING CHANGE: The PersistenceCollectionInterface Read, Update, and Delete method signatures have changed for improved type safety.
- Read now expects *core.QueryDSL instead of any.
- Delete now expects *core.QueryFilter instead of any.
- CollectionUpdate.Filter now expects *core.QueryFilter instead of any.

Client code implementing or directly calling these interfaces must update method signatures and argument types. For example, pass &queryBuilder.Build() instead of queryBuilder.Build().
