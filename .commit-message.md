refactor(core)!: reorganize core package into query and schema modules

The main 'core' package was becoming a monolith containing types and logic for schema definition, query building, and persistence interfaces. This refactoring splits it into three distinct sub-packages:

- core/schema: Contains all types related to schema definition (SchemaDefinition, FieldDefinition, IndexDefinition), validation, and migration helpers.
- core/query: Houses the QueryDSL, QueryBuilder, DataProcessor, and interfaces for query generation and execution.
- core/persistence: Provides the top-level Persistence and PersistenceCollection interfaces, orchestrating operations between the schema and query layers.

This change significantly improves modularity, maintainability, and clarifies the separation of concerns within the framework.

BREAKING CHANGE: The 'core' package has been refactored into 'core/query' and 'core/schema' for better modularity and separation of concerns.
- Schema definition types (e.g., core.SchemaDefinition, core.FieldDefinition, core.Issue, core.ValidationResult) are now found in 'github.com/asaidimu/go-anansi/core/schema'.
- Query-related types (e.g., core.QueryDSL, core.QueryFilter, core.QueryBuilder, core.ComparisonOperator, core.LogicalOperator, core.Document (now schema.Document), core.ComputeFunction, core.PredicateFunction, core.DataProcessor) are now found in 'github.com/asaidimu/go-anansi/core/query'.
- Top-level persistence interfaces and implementations (e.g., core.PersistenceInterface, core.PersistenceCollectionInterface, core.PersistenceEvent, core.RegisterSubscriptionOptions, core.CollectionUpdate) are now found in 'github.com/asaidimu/go-anansi/core/persistence'.
Consumers of the library must update their import paths to reflect these changes.
