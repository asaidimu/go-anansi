feat(persistence)!: implement dynamic collection and subscription listing

Refactor the persistence layer to improve event bus management and provide dynamic listing of collections and subscriptions.

- Pass event bus explicitly to NewCollection for centralized event handling.
- Add filtering to collection-scoped subscriptions to process only relevant events.
- Implement Persistence.Collections() to retrieve collection names from internal schema collection.
- Implement Persistence.Subscriptions() and CollectionBase.Subscriptions() to list active subscriptions.
- Refine Metadata and CollectionMetadata structs for clarity.

BREAKING CHANGE:
- The Persistence.Metadata method signature has changed: includeCollections and includeSchemas boolean parameters have been removed.
- The CollectionMetadata struct no longer includes LastModifiedAt and LastModifiedBy fields.
- The internal CollectionEvent struct has been removed, replaced by direct usage of PersistenceEvent.
