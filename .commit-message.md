feat(anansi)!: Introduce Anansi Go persistence and query framework

This commit marks a significant architectural overhaul, transforming the repository into the official Go implementation of the Anansi framework.

Key changes include:
- Refactored project structure with dedicated core, persistence, query, and sqlite modules.
- Defined core persistence interfaces, schema definitions, and event models.
- Implemented a robust persistence layer supporting CRUD, schema management, and eventing.
- Introduced a powerful declarative Query DSL with an in-memory processing engine for Go functions.
- Provided a production-ready SQLite adapter for data mapping and query execution.
- Rewrote the main.go example to showcase core functionalities.
- Updated .gitignore for new project structure and artifacts.
- Completely revamped README.md with comprehensive documentation and usage examples.

BREAKING CHANGE: The Go module path has changed from github.com/asaidimu/persistence to github.com/asaidimu/go-anansi. Users must update their go.mod files to reflect the new import path.
