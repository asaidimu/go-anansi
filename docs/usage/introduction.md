# Introduction

**Software Type**: API/Library (Confidence: 95%)

Anansi is a comprehensive toolkit for defining, versioning, migrating, and persisting structured data, enabling schema-driven development with powerful runtime validation and adaptable storage layers. This repository provides the **Go implementation** of the Anansi persistence and query framework.

Anansi is designed to bring a robust, schema-first approach to data persistence in Go applications. By externalizing data models into declarative JSON schema definitions, it allows for dynamic table creation, powerful querying, and a clear pathway for future data migrations and versioning. This framework aims to provide a high degree of flexibility and extensibility by abstracting the underlying storage mechanism.

The current implementation focuses on providing a production-ready SQLite adapter, demonstrating the core capabilities of the Anansi framework. While SQLite is the primary target for initial development, the architecture is built to support other database systems through a pluggable `persistence.DatabaseInteractor` interface. This project is still under active development, with several advanced features defined in interfaces awaiting full implementation.
